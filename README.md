# A website for browsing collections of Oral History.

## What is Oral History?

Oral history is historical sources in the form of audio. Most commonly audio history is in the form of interviews with older people, about events in their lives.

## Project overview

This project is a web app that makes searching and browsing through collections of oral history easy. Oral history sources are put through a Automatic Speech Recognition engine and text-transcriptions are then indexed using Elastic Search through the Azure Search API.

The app is hosted on Microsoft Azure, and is built using AngularJS and ASP.NET MVC 5. Design principles are inspired by Google's Material Design philosophy.
